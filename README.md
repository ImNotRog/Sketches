## WTH is p5js?

Convert, you non-JS-using peasant.

## Contents

| Path | Content |
|-|-|
|```data/pages.json```| A JSON file describing all p5js sketches included. |
|```scripts/compile-pages.js```| Because I am a lazy homo sapien, I made a script that automatically compiles the sketches for me instead of me manually writing them in. In fact, it's responsible for that table down below!|
|```sketches/*```| All my p5js sketches! Each sketch subdirectory contains an ```index.html```, a ```style.css``` file, and the actual project, which is in the ```sketch.js``` file.|
|```package.json```| Nodejs supremacy. |
|```README.md```| What do you think you're even reading right now??|
